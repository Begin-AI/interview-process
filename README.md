# :wave: Hello there

First things first: thank you for taking time to work on these code challenges, we trully appreciate it!

***

## How does this work? :thinking:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account

2. Inside of the folder `frontend` you will find more instructions related to the `dashboard` project (a simple weather application), review the Readme and get to work, simple like that :smile:
   1. The `dashboard` application is on a React tech stack.
3. Submit your Pull Request with a brief description of your changes and how many challenges you are implementing
4. Get a message back from us with our feedback

**Note: You have full ownership of the code. You can do any changes that you would want to as far as you follow the guidelines/expectations described on the project instructions**

Have fun! :sunglasses:
